# Community Science Museum Project

Overview
In this semester project, I undertook the challenge of creating an interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum. The primary focus was on engaging primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families. This project served as a culmination of my first-semester curriculum, showcasing both my design and coding skills.

## Description

Design Process
Inspiration and Colors
I began by researching museum layouts and drawing inspiration from popular museums worldwide. Opting for a child-friendly approach, I chose playful pink and green colors. The Trello board played a pivotal role in maintaining a structured workflow throughout the design and development phases.

Construction Phase
Responsive Design
I took a mobile-first approach during the design phase, ensuring responsiveness across devices. Utilizing CSS flex properties significantly improved the overall layout, making the website accessible and visually appealing.

Challenges and Learning
While constructing the site, I encountered challenges with the hamburger menu. Collaborating with classmates and referring to module resources helped resolve issues. The project provided a valuable learning experience, particularly in making CSS DRY and effectively using flex.

Implementation Phase
Version Control and Deployment
I maintained version control through a private GitHub repository, deploying the site on Netlify. Regular testing using Wave and W3 validator ensured a high standard of accessibility and code quality.
